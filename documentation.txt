To run the program, change the extension in the line 
f = open("output.txt","wb+")
to the extension of the file you want to compress e.g. "output.png" or "output.gif" if the input is a png or a gif.
Run the program and enter the name of the file you want to compress when prompted e.g. text.txt
The file must be in the same directory as the program
The encoding and decoding times will be displayed, the compressed file will be called compressed.txt
and the decoded file will be output.txt, output.png etc depending on the input type.
